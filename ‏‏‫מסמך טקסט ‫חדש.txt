1. Make the cake: Preheat the oven to 350˚F (180C˚). Butter two 8-inch (20cm) cake pans and line the bottoms with a parchment paper, grease the sides. Lightly dust with cocoa powder. Set aside.<br>
2. To a large bowl add flour, cocoa powder, sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Stir well and set aside. <br>

4. Add the wet mixture to the dry, whisk until incorporated. <br>
5. Pour the batter into prepared pans.<br>
6. Bake for 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. Let cool completely before frosting. <br>
7. Make the frosting: in a large bowl beat butter until light and fluffy. Add cream cheese and beat until combined and smooth. Add cocoa powder vanilla extract and salt. Beat until combined. gradually add powdered sugar, beat on low speed until combined and creamy. <br>
8. Transfer the frosting into a piping bag. Cut the top of the cakes.<br>

Notes:<br></h2>
• Use good quality cocoa powder.<br>
• You can bake both pans at the same time. My oven is too small, so I baked it separately. <br>
• If you don’t have buttermilk you can make homemade buttermilk: whisk 1 tablespoon of vinegar/lemon juice with 1 cup of milk and let sit for 10 minutes. <br><br><br>
